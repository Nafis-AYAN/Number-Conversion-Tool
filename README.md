# Number-Conversion-Tool
In this project we have any to base to any base convertor  which include base-2 to base-16. And also we have 2’s  Complement, binary operation &amp; long arithmetic summation. 

       “Motivation”
The motivation behind this project was to make a base to 
base number convertor tool with some other extra features. 
All this has been done in C programming language.

         “Features”
In this tool we added any to base to any base convertor 
which include base-2 to base-16. And also we have 2’s 
Complement, binary operation & long arithmetic summation. 

Number Convertor: Here we can do any base to any base 
number conversion as we want. First it will take the base of 
inputted number then the base we want to convert and lastly 
the number itself. 
Noted: It is limited between base-2 to base-16. 
As an example: (56)7 which is (2D)14

Special Feature: “A feature to continue this tool where if we 
press C the tool will continue and if we press Q the tool will 
exit”
“And also if we press wrong key it will show ‘Invalid Entry, 
Try again‘ and we will be able to enter again”

2’s Complement: Here we can do 2’s complement of any 
binary number. First we have input the number of bits then 
the number itself. 
It will show the result of 2’s complement of that binary 
number following the 1’s complement too. 

Binary Operation: Here in Binary operation we have all six 
binary operation. Bitwise or, Bitwise and, Bitwise xor, 
complement, left shift & right shift. 
First we will enter two number in the case of or, and, xor 
binary operation. It will show the output. In complement, left shift, right shift we will enter one 
number and it will show output. 
In both shift case we also have to input the number of bits we want to shift and here 
we called in a feature where it will show shift from 0 to the 
number, we want this to shift. 

Long Arithmetic Summation: Here we will input two very 
long numbers. It is greater than long long integer. The 
maximum character string size is 64,000. The string size we 
used in our program is 10,000.
That’s why we have to do this summation via string and 
using ASCII values of the number itself.

Tool Evaluation: We had a feature that we said was to 
continue and exit with the following C and Q key. If we press 
Q it will exit the program but it will also ask us to rate the 
tool between Excellent, Average and Poor. After we evaluate 
our conversion tool, it will thank us and will close the 
program
